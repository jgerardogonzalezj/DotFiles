Configuration files I use to manage my workload in Ubuntu WSL.

Requirements:
- awscli
- kubectl
- tmux
- In windows: I installed the font: Ubuntu Mono Powerline.ttf

Notes:
Use it under your own risk. There are no warranties at all.

In .profile you must edit the GOPATH and its conditional

In .tmux_coding you must edit the path where you want to start all the panes

In .tmux.cof you must edit <YOUR_USER> to be able to use the shorcut, or
comment the line

I'm using some plugins in tmux and vim.

You might require ctags (I'm using exuberant-ctags)

I'm not using zsh, I tried, but I didn't like it. maybe some day.
